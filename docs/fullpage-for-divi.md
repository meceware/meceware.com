![Divi Layers](assets/fullpage-for-divi/s05-layers.jpg "Divi Layers")

### Remove Sections

### Section Options

![Section Options](assets/fullpage-for-divi/s06-section-options.jpg "Section Options")

![Section Behaviour](assets/fullpage-for-divi/s07-section-behaviour.jpg "Section Behaviour")

When `Full Height` is selected, the height of the sections will be full screen.

When `Auto Height` is selected, the height of the section will take the height defined by your section/slide content.

When `Responsive Auto Height` is selected, sections will be full screen until the responsive mode gets fired. Then they'll take the size required by their content, which could be bigger or smaller than the viewport. Responsive mode can be activated when [Responsive Width](#responsive-width) or [Responsive Height](#responsive-height) options are set.

#### FullPage Anchor

If you are using FullPage with anchor links for the sections, then you will be able to use anchor links also to navigate directly to a certain slide inside a section.

This would be an example of a link with an anchor:
`http://yoursite.com/#secondPage`
(which is the URL you will see once you access to that section manually) Notice the last part of the URL ends in `#secondPage`, if FullPage Anchor option for that section is set to `secondPage`.

By default, uniquely generated anchors are used.

*Note: FullPage Anchor should be a unique ID and should NOT be the same with any CSS ID on the page.*

#### How can I deactivate my license if I don't have access to my site?

You can manage your licenses on the <a href="https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/dashboard/" target="_blank">dashboard</a>.

Alternatively, you can *deactivate* your license on the <a href="https://www.meceware.com/server/deactivate-fullpage/" target="_blank">deactivation page</a>. You will need the domain of your site, your license key and your email you used to purchase the plugin.

#### How can I generate the invoice for the plugin?

You would have received an email from Gumroad that shows the plugin license key as well as an *Invoice* button. You can generate your invoice by clicking on that button.

#### I cannot see extensions even if I installed the Extensions plugin!

FullPage extensions can be purchased separately and is not available with the plugin out-of-the-box. If you haven't purchased any extension, you don't need to use/activate the extensions plugin.

If you have purchased one or more extensions, please take a look at the [Extensions](#extensions "Extensions") section for the tutorial video that shows how to install them.

#### I see a red box about extension not activated!

Please find more information at [Extensions](#extensions "Extensions") part of the documentation. As specified there, you could see the red box when the extension is not activated. However, if you are on a development domain, **please ignore that message and do not activate for the development domain**. **The extension domain cannot be changed and once activated, refund for the extension would not be possible**. Once moved to the production domain, you can activate it and the red box will be disappeared automatically.

#### How can I show a normal web site on mobile and fullpage scrolling web site on desktop?

You can activate Responsive Mode. To activate Responsive Mode, please set [Responsive Width](#responsive-width "Responsive Width") option to `767` (or any screen width you want). That's it! For the screens that has width less than `767px`, a normal scrolling web site will be shown.

You can also try setting [Responsive Auto-Height](#section-behaviour "Section Behaviour") option for the sections.

#### I cannot scroll to my footer!

If scrollbars are disabled, only the content inside the sections are visible. To be able to show the footer, it needs to be moved inside a section. You can use the [Show Theme Footer](#show-theme-footer "Show Theme Footer") customization.

#### Sections are getting cut off! I cannot see the rest of my content!

When the scrollbars are disabled and your content is greater than the screen height, some of your content might be left outside of the viewport. To display these, you can enable [Scroll Overflow](#scroll-overflow "Scroll Overflow") option. This will create an in-section scrollbar.

#### How do I remove anchors from URL?

If you want to remove the anchors (your-domaion.com/`#anchor`), you can enable [Lock Anchors](#lock-anchors "Lock Anchors") or [Disable Anchors](#disable-anchors "Disable Anchors") option. Enabling one of these two options will remove the anchor part from the URL.

#### Why my scroll based animations or events don't work?

Some of the WordPress plugins or Javascript libraries that depend on scrolling mechanism such as sticky menus, animations etc. might not work if scroll bar is disabled using the plugin. Please enable the [Scroll Bar](#scroll-bar "Scroll Bar") option to enable scroll based animations.
