### Section Options

![Section Options](assets/fullpage-for-gutenberg/section-section.jpg "Section Options")

#### Section Behaviour

This option defines the behaviour of the section.

When *Full Height* is selected, the height of the sections will be fullscreen.

When *Auto Height* is selected, the height of the section will take the height defined by your section/slide content.

When *Responsive Auto Height* is selected, sections will be fullscreen until the responsive mode gets fired. Then they'll take the size required by their content, which could be bigger or smaller than the viewport.

#### FullPage Anchor

If you are using FullPage with anchor links for the sections, then you will be able to use anchor links also to navigate directly to a certain slide inside a section.

This would be an example of a link with an anchor:
`http://yoursite.com/#secondPage`
(which is the URL you will see once you access to that section manually) Notice the last part of the URL ends in `#secondPage`, if FullPage Anchor option for that section is set to `secondPage`.

#### Navigation Tooltip

This option defines the tooltips to show for the navigation circles in case they are being used.

#### Disable Scroll Overflow

This option is used to prevent fullpage.js from creating the scrollbar in certain sections or slides. When Scroll Overflow is enabled but the scrollbars in this section is not needed, enable this option.

### Section Background Options

![Section Background Options](assets/fullpage-for-gutenberg/section-background.jpg "Section Background Options")

These group of options define the background color, background image and background video options for the specified section.

#### Section Background Color

#### Section Background Video

To choose the background video, click on the *Video* tab to see the video parameters. The background color indicates the video overlay color. Poster image is the image that is shown while the video is downloaded until playing the video.

![Section Background Options](assets/fullpage-for-gutenberg/section-background-video.jpg "Section Background Video Options")

Enable *Enable Video On Mobile* option to play the video on mobile devices. If this option is disabled, the video will NOT be loaded on mobile devices. Only poster image will be displayed. Disabling this option is best practice.

To loop the video, enable *Loop* option.

The mute the video sound, enable *Mute* option.

When *Auto Play* option is enabled, the video will be played as soon as it's playable.

When *Always Play* option is enabled, the video plays even if the section is not active. When disabled, the video only plays if the section is active, otherwise the video is paused. This option does not work with Vimeo videos.

To use a Youtube or Vimeo video, simply put the video link inside *YouTube/Vimeo Video URL* option.

To use self-hosted videos, *Self-Hosted* from *Video Type* option and select mp4, ogv/ogg (optional) and webm (optional) videos from media library.

The anchor at the end of the URL `#secondPage/2` defines the section and slide of destination respectively. In the previous URL, the section of destination will be the one defined with the anchor secondPage and the slide will be the 2nd slide, as we are using the index 2 for it. (the fist slide of a section has index 0, as technically it is a section).

If a custom anchor is needed for a slide instead of its index, you can enter the new slide anchor to *Slide Anchor* option.

Yes, you can! You can *deactivate* your license on your old server and use the same license on your new server. Don't forget to *Deactivate*. Please see [License Key](#license-key "License Key") section for more information.

#### How can I generate the invoice for the plugin?

You would have received an email from Gumroad that shows the plugin license key as well as an *Invoice* button. You can generate your invoice by clicking on that button.

#### I cannot see extensions even if I installed the Extensions plugin!

FullPage extensions can be purchased separately and is not available with the plugin out-of-the-box. If you haven't purchased any extension, you don't need to use/activate the extensions plugin.

If you have purchased one or more extensions, please take a look at the [Extensions](#extensions "Extensions") section for the tutorial video that shows how to install them.

#### How can I show a normal web site on mobile and fullpage scrolling web site on desktop?

You can activate Responsive Mode. To activate Responsive Mode, please set [Responsive Width](#responsive-width "Responsive Width") option to `767` (or any screen width you want). That's it! For the screens that has width less than `767px`, a normal scrolling web site will be shown.

You can also try setting [Responsive Auto-Height](#section-behaviour "Section Behaviour") option for the sections.

#### I cannot see my header and footer!

By default, empty page template is enabled. To disable it, please take a look at the [tutorial video](#enable-empty-page-template "Enable Empty Page Template").

#### I cannot scroll to my footer!

If scrollbars are disabled, only the content inside the sections are visible. To be able to show the footer, it needs to be moved inside a section. You can use the [Show Theme Footer](#show-theme-footer "Show Theme Footer") customization.

#### Sections are getting cut off! I cannot see the rest of my content!

When the scrollbars are disabled and your content is greater than the screen height, some of your content might be left outside of the viewport. To display these, you can enable [Scroll Overflow](#scroll-overflow "Scroll Overflow") option. This will create an in-section scrollbar.

#### The Block Generates Error / FullPage Block Contains Unexpected or Invalid Content

Sometimes with the update of Gutenberg, WordPress or other third party plugins, FullPage block might generate an error. If you see `This block contains unexpected or invalid content.` instead of the FullPage block, please first take a database backup, just in case, and use `Attempt Block Recovery` button. Do NOT use `Convert to Classic Block` option.

![License Settings](assets/fullpage-for-gutenberg/attemp-block-recovery.jpg "Attempt Block Recovery for FullPage for Gutenberg")

#### How do I remove anchors from URL?

If you want to remove the anchors (your-domaion.com/`#anchor`), you can enable [Lock Anchors](#lock-anchors "Lock Anchors") or [Disable Anchors](#disable-anchors "Disable Anchors") option. Enabling one of these two options will remove the anchor part from the URL.

#### Why my scroll based animations or events don't work?

Some of the WordPress plugins or Javascript libraries that depend on scrolling mechanism such as sticky menus, animations etc. might not work if scroll bar is disabled using the plugin. Please enable the [Scroll Bar](#scroll-bar "Scroll Bar") option to enable scroll based animations.
