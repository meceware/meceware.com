![Section Behaviour](assets/fullpage-for-gutenberg/section-behaviour.jpg "Section Behaviour")

When `Full Height` is selected, the height of the sections will be fullscreen.

When `Auto Height` is selected, the height of the section will take the height defined by your section/slide content.

When `Responsive Auto Height` is selected, sections will be fullscreen until the responsive mode gets fired. Then they'll take the size required by their content, which could be bigger or smaller than the viewport.

#### FullPage Anchor

If you are using FullPage with anchor links for the sections, then you will be able to use anchor links also to navigate directly to a certain slide inside a section.

This would be an example of a link with an anchor:
`http://yoursite.com/#secondPage`
(which is the URL you will see once you access to that section manually) Notice the last part of the URL ends in `#secondPage`, if FullPage Anchor option for that section is set to `secondPage`.

*Note: FullPage Anchor should NOT be the same with any anchor ID on the page.*

#### Navigation Tooltip

This option defines the tooltips to show for the navigation circles in case they are being used.

#### Disable Scroll Overflow

This option is used to prevent `fullpage.js` from creating the scrollbar in certain sections or slides. When Scroll Overflow is enabled but the scrollbars in this section is not needed, enable this option.

This option enables Empty Page Template option. By default FullPage for Gutenberg comes with an empty page template, and this option is enabled. When FullPage is enabled, an empty page with no theme dependency is loaded.

You can disable this option and load theme template. When this option is disabled, theme header and footer is loaded as well. You might need to know CSS and JavaScript to change the behaviour of the page.

#### Use Template Redirect

This parameter defines if template will be redirected or included. If set, template will be redirected, otherwise template will be included. Play with this setting to see the best scenario that fits. This option is enabled only when Empty Page Template is used.

#### Template Path

#### Remove Theme JS

This parameter removes theme JavaScript files from output. Be aware, this might crash the page output if the theme has JS output on the head section.

Enable this option if you want to remove theme JavaScript files, on necessary cases such as conflicts between theme and FullPage. Enabling this option is not recommended on production environments, and is used for debugging purposes.

## FAQ

#### Can I move my license to another server?

Yes, you can! You can *deactivate* your license on your old server and use the same license on your new server. Don't forget to *Deactivate*. Please see [License Key](#license-key "License Key") section for more information.

#### How can I deactivate my license if I don't have access to my site?

You can *deactivate* your license on the <a href="https://www.meceware.com/server/deactivate-fullpage/" target="_blank">deactivation page</a>. You will need the domain of your site, your license key and your email you used to purchase the plugin.

#### How can I generate the invoice for the plugin?

You would have received an email from Gumroad that shows the plugin license key as well as an *Invoice* button. You can generate your invoice by clicking on that button.

#### I cannot see extensions even if I installed the Extensions plugin!

FullPage extensions can be purchased separately and is not available with the plugin out-of-the-box. If you haven't purchased any extension, you don't need to use/activate the extensions plugin.

If you have purchased one or more extensions, please take a look at the [Extensions](#extensions "Extensions") section for the tutorial video that shows how to install them.

#### I see a red box about extension not activated!

Please find more information at [Extensions](#extensions "Extensions") part of the documentation. As specified there, you could see the red box when the extension is not activated. However, if you are on a development domain, **please ignore that message and do not activate for the development domain**. **The extension domain cannot be changed and once activated, refund for the extension would not be possible**. Once moved to the production domain, you can activate it and the red box will be disappeared automatically.

#### How can I show a normal web site on mobile and fullpage scrolling web site on desktop?

You can activate Responsive Mode. To activate Responsive Mode, please set [Responsive Width](#responsive-width "Responsive Width") option to `767` (or any screen width you want). That's it! For the screens that has width less than `767px`, a normal scrolling web site will be shown.

You can also try setting [Responsive Auto-Height](#section-behaviour "Section Behaviour") option for the sections.

#### I cannot see my header and footer!

By default, empty page template is enabled. To disable it, please take a look at the [tutorial video](#enable-empty-page-template "Enable Empty Page Template").

#### I cannot scroll to my footer!

If scrollbars are disabled, only the content inside the sections are visible. To be able to show the footer, it needs to be moved inside a section. You can use the [Show Theme Footer](#show-theme-footer "Show Theme Footer") customization.

#### Sections are getting cut off! I cannot see the rest of my content!

When the scrollbars are disabled and your content is greater than the screen height, some of your content might be left outside of the viewport. To display these, you can enable [Scroll Overflow](#scroll-overflow "Scroll Overflow") option. This will create an in-section scrollbar.

#### The Block Generates Error / FullPage Block Contains Unexpected or Invalid Content

Sometimes with the update of Gutenberg, WordPress or other third party plugins, FullPage block might generate an error. If you see `This block contains unexpected or invalid content.` instead of the FullPage block, please first take a database backup, just in case, and use `Attempt Block Recovery` button. Do NOT use `Convert to Classic Block` option.

#### Why my scroll based animations or events don't work?
