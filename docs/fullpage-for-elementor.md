![Enable FullPage for Elementor](assets/fullpage-for-elementor/s05-page-settings.jpg "Enable FullPage for Elementor")

## Sections

Each Elementor Section widget or top Container widget on the page is defined as fullpage section.

![How To Add Sections](assets/fullpage-for-elementor/g02-add-sections.gif "How To Add Sections")

### Add Sections

Drag and drop any Elementor widget inside the widget drop area, or click on the plus sign.

![Elementor Drop Area](assets/fullpage-for-elementor/s06-drop-area.jpg "Elementor Drop Area")

Every time a widget is added, a new section is created. You can check the sections via `Navigator`.

![Elementor Navigator](assets/fullpage-for-elementor/s07-navigator.jpg "Elementor Navigator")

### Remove Sections

* Right click on the section/container widget and click on `Delete`.

### Section Options

![Section Options](assets/fullpage-for-elementor/s08-section-options.jpg "Section Options")

#### Has Horizontal Slides

This option enables the specified section as horizontal slides container.

#### Section Behaviour

This option defines the behaviour of the section.

![Section Behaviour](assets/fullpage-for-elementor/s09-section-behaviour.jpg "Section Behaviour")

When `Full Height` is selected, the height of the sections will be full screen.

When `Auto Height` is selected, the height of the section will take the height defined by your section/slide content.

When `Responsive Auto Height` is selected, sections will be full screen until the responsive mode gets fired. Then they'll take the size required by their content, which could be bigger or smaller than the viewport.

#### FullPage Anchor

If you are using FullPage with anchor links for the sections, then you will be able to use anchor links also to navigate directly to a certain slide inside a section.

This would be an example of a link with an anchor:
`http://yoursite.com/#secondPage`
(which is the URL you will see once you access to that section manually) Notice the last part of the URL ends in `#secondPage`, if FullPage Anchor option for that section is set to `secondPage`.

By default, uniquely generated anchors are used.

*Note: FullPage Anchor should be a unique ID and should NOT be the same with any anchor ID on the page.*

#### Navigation Tooltip

This option defines the tooltips to show for the navigation bullets in case they are being used.

#### Disable Scroll Overflow

This option is used to prevent creating the scrollbar in certain sections or slides. Enable this option when [Scroll Overflow](#scroll-overflow) is enabled but the scrollbars in this section is not needed.

#### Full Height Columns

This option makes the column height same with section height.

#### Navigation Colors

If you want to change the (left/right) navigation bullet colors for the active section, you can change the colors using these options. This will override the navigation colors only on the selected section.

## Slides

Slides are the horizontal FullPage elements inside fullpage sections.

Each `Inner Section` or `Container` widget inside the Elementor Sections or top `Container` Widget are set as FullPage Slides if [*Has Horizontal Slides*](#has-horizontal-slides) option of the section is enabled.

![How To Add Slides](assets/fullpage-for-elementor/g03-add-slides.gif "How To Add Slides")

*Note: When a section is enabled as a Slide, only Inner Section or Container widgets can be placed inside the fullpage section. No other widgets should be placed inside the section other than Inner Section or Container.*

### Add Slides

* Enable [*Has Horizontal Slides*](#has-horizontal-slides) option of the section.
* Add `Inner Section` widgets inside the section, or `Container` widgets inside the top container.
* Add your content inside the `Inner Section` or `Container` widgets.

### Remove Slides

* Remove the `Inner Section` or `Container`.

### Slide Options

![Slide Options](assets/fullpage-for-elementor/s10-slide-options.jpg "Slide Options")

If a custom anchor is needed for a slide instead of its index, you can enter the new slide anchor to `Slide Anchor` option. If set, the anchor of the slide will be `#section_anchor/slide_anchor`. If this option is left empty, the anchor of the slide will be `#section_anchor/2` where 2 is the slide number.

### Vertical Alignment

This option defines vertical position of the content within sections.

### Responsive Width

A normal scroll will be used under the defined width in pixels. A class `fp-responsive` is added to the body tag in case the user wants to use it for their own responsive CSS. For example, if set to 900, whenever the browser's width is less than `900` the plugin will scroll like a normal site.

If you have purchased one or more extensions, please take a look at the [Extensions](#extensions "Extensions") section for the tutorial video that shows how to install them.

#### I see a red box about extension not activated!

Please find more information at [Extensions](#extensions "Extensions") part of the documentation. As specified there, you could see the red box when the extension is not activated. However, if you are on a development domain, **please ignore that message and do not activate for the development domain**. **The extension domain cannot be changed and once activated, refund for the extension would not be possible**. Once moved to the production domain, you can activate it and the red box will be disappeared automatically.

#### How can I show a normal web site on mobile and fullpage scrolling web site on desktop?

You can activate Responsive Mode. To activate Responsive Mode, please set [Responsive Width](#responsive-width "Responsive Width") option to `767` (or any screen width you want). That's it! For the screens that has width less than `767px`, a normal scrolling web site will be shown.

You can also try setting [Responsive Auto-Height](#section-behaviour "Section Behaviour") option for the sections.

#### I cannot see my header and footer!

By default, the plugin comes with an empty page template. This means that, while fullPage is enabled on your WordPress site, an empty page with no theme dependency will be loaded. That's why your header or footer does not appear on your site. To disable it, please take a look at the [tutorial video](#enable-empty-page-template "Enable Empty Page Template").

#### I cannot scroll to my footer!

If scrollbars are disabled, only the content inside the sections are visible. To be able to show the footer, it needs to be moved inside a section. You can use the [Show Theme Footer](#show-theme-footer "Show Theme Footer") customization.

#### Sections are getting cut off! I cannot see the rest of my content!

When the scrollbars are disabled and your content is greater than the screen height, some of your content might be left outside of the viewport. To display these, you can enable [Scroll Overflow](#scroll-overflow "Scroll Overflow") option. This will create an in-section scrollbar.

#### How do I remove anchors from URL?

If you want to remove the anchors (your-domaion.com/`#anchor`), you can enable [Lock Anchors](#lock-anchors "Lock Anchors") or [Disable Anchors](#disable-anchors "Disable Anchors") option. Enabling one of these two options will remove the anchor part from the URL.

#### Why my scroll based animations or events don't work?

Some of the WordPress plugins or Javascript libraries that depend on scrolling mechanism such as sticky menus, animations etc. might not work if scroll bar is disabled using the plugin. Please enable the [Scroll Bar](#scroll-bar "Scroll Bar") option to enable scroll based animations.

#### Updating From v1.X to v2.0

FullPage for Elementor plugin has a major update that changes a lot of things under the hood! To update the plugin from `v1.X` to `v2.X`, please follow the instructions below:

- Before updating, please take a **database backup** as a precaution.

- Update FullPage for Elementor plugin to the latest version.

- For each page/post designed with FullPage for Elementor (FullPage is enabled):

  - Edit the page/post.

  - Check [Easing](#easing) option under [Scrolling tab](#scrolling) of FullPage options. If you used a different CSS easing before, please check the option if it’s the correct one. If you used a JS easing on your site (for fixed background images as an example), please disable `CSS Easing` option and select the correct option from `Easing` option.

  - `Top` and `Bottom` options are removed from [Vertical Alignment](#vertical-alignment) under [Design tab](#design) of FullPage options. Instead `Default` option can be selected and vertical alignment can be adjusted from Elementor section options. Please check the vertical alignment of sections.

  - For Offset Section extension users, if you have changed the default option of `Data Centered` option for any section, please update it again to the correct value. This option can be found under FullPage option for each section.

  - For users that have custom CSS or JavaScript options, please check your site after the update. You can use [support](/contact "Contact") for your customized scripts and styles.
